Overview
The goal of this project is to build a Linear Regression model that accurately predicts insurance costs using customer data. This can help insurance companies assess premiums more effectively and identify key factors influencing costs.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

age: The age of the individual.
sex: Gender (encoded as 0 for female, 1 for male).
bmi: Body Mass Index.
children: Number of children/dependents.
smoker: Smoking status (encoded as 0 for non-smokers, 1 for smokers).
region: Geographical region (encoded as integers).
expenses: Actual insurance costs (target variable).
Installation
To run this project locally, you need Python and the following libraries installed:

numpy
